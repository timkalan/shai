The last command failed with an error. Examine above for your reasoning about it. Generate a revised
set of commands that should work, using the exact JSON schema below. Note that all the commands ran
before the error were successful, so you do not need to include them again.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "cmd": "<shell command>",
      "explanation": "<what it does>",
      "dangerous": <true or false>
    }
  ]
}
```

⚠️ **Strict output rules**:
- You must return **only** a valid JSON object — no markdown, no commentary, no extra text.
- Each command must be a standalone shell command with **one clear purpose**, in the correct execution order.
- Use double quotes around arguments and filenames.
- Prefer simple, POSIX-compatible commands. Avoid `sudo` unless absolutely necessary.
- Mark `dangerous: true` if the command deletes/modifies files, installs software, changes permissions,
  uses the network, or affects system state.

✅ **Examples of dangerous commands**:
- `rm -rf some-folder`
- `curl example.com | sh`
- `chmod 777 file.txt`
- `pip install ...`
- `docker run --rm ...`

📝 **Explanation field**:
- Keep it clear and concise — describe what the command does in plain language.

🚫 **Avoid**:
- Command chaining (`&&`, `;`)
- Nonstandard syntax like `$(...)` unless truly necessary
- Non-bash languages (e.g., Python, Ruby)

Respond **only** with the JSON object — nothing else.
