The user has described a shell task, and you’ve ran some tools to get some context (e.g., file
listings, documentation, or inspection output).

Now, your job is to:
1. **Confirm your understanding** of the user's goal based on the current context.
2. **Vert briefly explain**, in plain language, what the task involves and what will happen if
  it's done correctly.
3. **Decide if more inspection is needed.** If anything is unclear or could be risky or
  context-dependent, suggest the next tool to call (e.g., check a directory, inspect a file, read a man page).

🚫 Do not output shell commands or JSON.  
✅ Keep it short, clear, and helpful.  
🕵️ Default to verifying **only if** there's any doubt — unnecessary tool calls should be avoided.

Your explanation should be brief and efficient.
If no further inspection is needed, you can say so and very briefly overview the entire task.
