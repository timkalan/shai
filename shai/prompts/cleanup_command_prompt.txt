You have completed the user's request! Congrats! Now, if you think that some additional cleanup
commands are necessary, generate them in the exact JSON format below. If you don't think
any additional cleanup commands are needed, just return an empty JSON object `{}`.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "cmd": "<shell command>",
      "explanation": "<what it does>",
      "dangerous": <true or false>
    }
  ]
}
```

⚠️ **Strict output rules**:
- You must return **only** a valid JSON object — no markdown, no commentary, no extra text.
- Each command must be a standalone shell command with **one clear purpose**, in the correct execution order.
- Use double quotes around arguments and filenames.
- Prefer simple, POSIX-compatible commands. Avoid `sudo` unless absolutely necessary.
- Mark `dangerous: true` if the command deletes/modifies files, installs software, changes permissions,
  uses the network, or affects system state.

✅ **Examples of dangerous commands**:
- `rm -rf some-folder`
- `curl example.com | sh`
- `chmod 777 file.txt`
- `pip install ...`
- `docker run --rm ...`

📝 **Explanation field**:
- Keep it clear and concise — describe what the command does in plain language.

🚫 **Avoid**:
- Command chaining (`&&`, `;`)
- Nonstandard syntax like `$(...)` unless truly necessary

Respond **only** with the JSON object — nothing else.
